# QuestLog — Implementation Notes

**Purpose:** Non-obvious decisions and gotchas that aren't derivable from reading the code. Read at the start of every session. Add an entry when you make a non-obvious decision.

**Last Updated:** 2026-04-08

## Session notes (Milestone 4.1) — Main-area editor + dock model (revised)

### Editor surfaces: two, not one
As of the 4.1 revision, the session editor has **two surfaces** that share state via save-and-remount:

1. **Full editor** at `/campaign/:id/sessions/:sessionId` — main-area view, centered at `var(--sessionlog-max-width)` (720px). This is the default writing surface.
2. **Dock** — narrow right-rail panel at `var(--dock-width)` (360px). Activated by the **Dock** button in the full editor; the main area then shows whatever route the DM navigates to. Deactivated by **Undock** (returns to the full editor) or the close button.

### Why save-and-remount instead of a single shared TipTap instance
The revised visual spec asked for a single TipTap instance lifted into context so it could swap mount points without losing state. We rejected this because:
- TipTap's `EditorContent` can only be mounted in one DOM location at a time, so moving the instance still requires unmount/remount — the "shared" aspect only preserves **unsaved** in-memory state between the swap.
- Autosave debounces at 2s; the only scenario where save-and-remount loses state is if the user docks/undocks within that 2s window while typing. To mitigate, docking **flushes the autosave** before navigating — no data loss in practice.
- In exchange for covering that edge case, we get a dramatically simpler state model (no lifted-editor context, no manual mount-point forwarding); each surface owns its own `useEditor` call keyed on `sessionId`.

### Route structure
```
/campaign/:id/sessions                → SessionListPage
/campaign/:id/sessions/:sessionId     → SessionEditorPage  (main-area full editor)
```
Clicking a session card navigates to the editor page. Clicking "Dock" flushes the save, sets `isDocked = true`, and navigates back to `/campaign/:id/sessions` (or whatever the previous route was). The dock panel reads the active session id from context.

### CampaignChromeContext semantics (revised)
The context was extended rather than replaced:
- `panelOpen` / `panelTab` / `agentChatContextSources` — unchanged, still powers the agent-chat right panel.
- `activeSessionId` — the session currently loaded in the editor (full or docked).
- `isDocked: boolean` — replaces the old `notesLayout: 'panel' | 'full'` pairing. When `true`, the dock panel renders in the third grid column.
- `dockSession(id)` / `undock()` — helpers that set state and flush autosave before transitions.

`notesLayout` and related full/panel helpers were removed because the main-area editor is now a real route, not a conditional overlay on `<Outlet />`.

### Metadata block: Notion-style, not form-style
`SessionMetadata` now renders:
1. Overline: `SESSION N · FORMATTED_DATE · DRAFT` (or `✓ SESSION N · ...` in `--status-success` when finalized). Font: `--font-mono` 10px uppercase. The date portion is a click-to-edit span that reveals a styled native date picker.
2. Title: borderless `<input>` styled as a display heading (`--font-display` 17px weight 600). Commits on blur.
3. Separator: 1px `--border-subtle`.

Session number is **not inline-editable** — it's auto-incremented on create and only editable from the finalize form.

### Deleted: `SessionNotesPanel.tsx`
The original 4.1 pass created a single `SessionNotesPanel` component used in both panel and full layouts. It was deleted in the revision because the full editor is now a route-backed page with its own header chrome, and the dock panel has different header chrome (session switcher, undock) that didn't share code with the full editor's header (back link, dock button). The real reusables — `SessionMetadata`, `SessionEditor`, `SaveStatus`, `FinalizeForm` — are shared between `SessionEditorPage` and `DockedSessionPanel` directly.

### TipTap storage
`sessions.content` is a **string** storing `JSON.stringify(editor.getJSON())` (TipTap document JSON). Plain text or legacy rows are still parsed: if `JSON.parse` fails, the editor wraps the string in a single paragraph.

### Auto-save debounce
`useSessionAutoSave` debounces **2 seconds** after the last edit, then calls `session.update` with the full JSON document. This is server-side persistence; Milestone 12 adds localStorage crash recovery as a separate layer (see PRD §4.3 acceptance criterion 8).

### Right panel shell
`CampaignChromeProvider` holds `panelOpen`, `panelTab`, and `activeSessionId` (for the session list → notes panel handoff). **`ChatPage` syncs cited sources** via **`setAgentChatContextSources`**. **`AppShell`** renders **`ContextPanel`** when the path matches agent chat; **`AppShell`** clears **`agentChatContextSources`** when the path leaves that route.

**Do not** derive those sources from the merged **`messages`** array used for the transcript: it updates every streaming tick, so syncing it through context in a **`useEffect`** can **`setState` every render** and hit **maximum update depth**. Use **`useChat`’s `agentContextSources`** (memoized from **`conversation.getMessages`** data only).

### Notes layout (`panel` vs `full`)
`notesLayout` lives in `CampaignChromeProvider`. **Full** mode closes the right panel and renders `SessionNotesPanel` in `<main>` instead of `<Outlet />`. Changing **route** (`location.pathname`) or leaving a campaign (**no `campaignId`**) calls `resetNotesLayout()` so full mode does not stick across navigation. ⌘⇧N (`openNotes`) forces **panel** layout and opens the notes tab.

### Session metadata saves
`SessionMetadata` commits **title**, **date**, and **session number** on **blur** (and title draft syncs from props). Redundant `session.update` calls are skipped when the parsed value matches the loaded session.

### Rail draft dot
`Rail` uses `trpc.session.list` (60s `staleTime`) to show a draft badge on Session logs when any row has `status === "draft"`. This is best-effort UX, not real-time sync.

### Test DB migrations
If `questlog_test` predates a migration, run `pnpm --filter @questlog/server db:migrate` with `DATABASE_URL` pointing at that database. Vitest uses `questlog_test` (see `apps/server/vitest.config.ts`); CI should apply migrations fresh.

### `db:migrate` must use the same `DATABASE_URL` as `pnpm dev`
The server dev script loads **repo-root** `.env` via `tsx --env-file=../../.env`. The migrate script does the same (`apps/server/package.json` → `db:migrate`). Before that fix, `dotenv/config` in `migrate.ts` only looked for `.env` in `apps/server/` (usually missing), so the migrator fell back to a default DB while dev used root `.env` — **migrations could run against the wrong database** and the app would still log `relation "campaigns" does not exist` on the DB you actually connect to.

### M4.1 morning-review fixes (2026-04-13)

**Test navigation assertions (Node 24 / undici incompatibility):** React Router v7's data router creates a `Request` with an `AbortSignal` during navigation; Node 24's newer undici rejected it with a type error, so navigation tests that awaited a rendered destination element always timed out. Fixed by mocking `useNavigate` at the module level in `SessionListPage.test.tsx` and `DockedSessionPanel.test.tsx` and asserting the mock was called with the correct path, rather than checking the rendered destination.

**`lastSavedRef` removed from `useSessionAutoSave` return:** It leaked internal state into the public API. No consumer ever used it — removed from the return object.

**`buttonSmallAccent` / `buttonSmallSecondary` presets:** The compact header button style (`padding: "4px 12px", fontSize: "0.75rem"` spread over `buttonAccent`/`buttonSecondary`) was copy-pasted across `DockedSessionPanel`, `SessionEditorPage`, `SessionNotesPanel`, and `FinalizeForm`. Extracted to `apps/web/src/components/styles.ts` as named presets; all usages updated.

**`isDocked` is intentionally ephemeral (not localStorage):** Unlike `panelOpen`, dock state resets on page reload. This is by design — a stale docked session on reload would be confusing since the user's context is gone. `panelOpen` persists because it reflects a layout preference; dock state reflects an active workflow.

**`undock()` intentionally preserves `activeSessionId`:** The caller (e.g. `DockedSessionPanel`'s undock button) uses the id to navigate to the full editor immediately after calling `undock()`. Clearing it in `undock()` would create a race.

## Component directory organization (M4.5 polish, 2026-04-24)

### Why by-kind over the original primitives/feedback/layout split
The M4.5 overnight agent created `components/primitives/`, `components/feedback/`, and `components/layout/` but left Button, Card, IconButton, and EntityAvatar at the root. This created a logic gap: Chip (in `primitives/`) and Button (at root) are the same category of component. The rule "new primitive goes in primitives/" had no consistent answer for root-level siblings.

The follow-up refactor (branch `refactor/component-reorg`) commits fully to **by-kind**:

```
buttons/    — interactive click targets (Button, IconButton, Chip)
inputs/     — form primitives (FormField, Input, Select, Textarea)
surfaces/   — displayable containers (Card, EntityAvatar)
feedback/   — status messages (Alert; future Toast, Banner)
overlays/   — portal/dialog patterns (Modal)
layout/     — page shells (PageScaffold)
utilities/  — non-UI helpers (ErrorBoundary, PlaceholderPage)
```

Feature imports use the subdirectory path directly (e.g. `../../components/buttons/Button.js`). No root barrel — one was added briefly and removed because every callsite preferred the explicit subdir path, and an unused `export *` barrel silently widens the public surface (internal helpers become reachable; later name collisions resolve silently).

### Half-step spacing tokens
The 4px-grid tokens (`--space-1` through `--space-8`) left gaps at 2px, 6px, 10px, and 14px. These values appeared throughout button padding, chip padding, input padding, and panel section headings. Rather than rounding to the nearest grid step (which would have shifted visuals), four half-step tokens were added:

```css
--space-0-5: 2px   /* micro-gap: list items, inline edit inputs */
--space-1-5: 6px   /* button vertical padding, tight flex gaps */
--space-2-5: 10px  /* input/panel vertical padding, section spacing */
--space-3-5: 14px  /* button/input horizontal padding */
```

`3px` and `5px` values were intentionally left as literals — they appear in only 2–3 places each (ghost button and source chip vertical padding; ChatHeader compact button) and don't align cleanly to a half-step. Adding tokens for single-location values creates noise.

## Session notes (Milestone 4.2) — Entity Detection & Linking (2026-04-25)

### Orphaned entity marks removed on re-scan (spec deviation)

The PRD spec says entity marks that lose their backing entity on a re-scan should be downgraded to the `unlinked` state (so the text stays highlighted as an unresolved reference). The current implementation removes them from the document entirely. The design constraint is that `setEntitySpans` rebuilds marks from the fresh server response; a removed entity simply doesn't appear in that response, so there's no signal to downgrade rather than remove.

This is acceptable for now because the entity knowledge base is append-only at this stage — entities are never deleted. If entity deletion is added later, this deviation must be revisited: the correct fix is to pass a "previously confirmed entity ids" set into `setEntitySpans` and downgrade any mark whose `entityId` is no longer found in the session's entity list.

### Link button deferred (EntityActionBar)

The `Link` button in `EntityActionBar` is a deliberate no-op (`onClick={() => {}}`). Wiring it requires a campaign entity search popover (search-as-you-type, results list, select to link). This is planned for M5.4 (NER-based entity suggestion), at which point the popover also serves as the link picker. The `onLink` prop is retained in the component interface so the call site remains stable.

### `story_arc` → `arc` rename

`ENTITY_TYPES` in `packages/shared/src/constants/index.ts` originally used `"story_arc"`. All M4.2 code (CSS classes `entity-span--arc`, design tokens `--ent-arc`, `EntityType` in `session-log/types.ts`) used `"arc"`. The two callers of the old name were in `components/styles.ts` (`entityBorderColors` and `entityAvatarColors` object keys) and `agent-chat/components/context/ContextPanel.tsx` (`guessEntityType` fallback return). Both updated to `"arc"` in the M4.2 review session. `packages/shared/src/validators/entity.ts` now uses `z.enum(ENTITY_TYPES)` directly instead of a local alias.

### `pg_trgm` extension must be in the migration, not just `migrate.ts`

Migration `0006_entity_linking_schema.sql` adds `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;` as its first statement. The earlier pattern (enabling the extension only inside `migrate.ts` at runtime) meant a CI-applied migration would fail on a fresh Postgres instance that didn't have the extension yet. SQL-first is safer: the extension is present before any subsequent statement in that transaction.

## Database Migrations

### Always use `db:migrate` (the journal), never `drizzle-kit push` for shared envs
CI runs `pnpm --filter @questlog/server db:migrate`, which only applies migrations listed in `apps/server/src/db/migrations/meta/_journal.json`. Drizzle-kit's `push` command bypasses the journal entirely and edits the live schema. Mixing the two leaves SQL files on disk that never run in CI — exactly what happened before 2026-04-06: migration `0002_add_messages_token_usage.sql` and the 1024→1536 vector mismatch in `0000` were both invisible to the migrator because (a) `0002` was never journaled and (b) someone had `push`'d the 1024-dim `embedding` column locally without generating an ALTER migration. Tests passed locally and hard-failed in CI as soon as `continue-on-error` was removed for milestone 3.3.6.

**Rule:** every schema change must produce a journaled migration. If you ever run `drizzle-kit push` against a dev DB, immediately run `drizzle-kit generate` and commit both the SQL file and the journal entry.

### `chunks.embedding` is `vector(1024)` to match Voyage AI voyage-3
The original migration created `vector(1536)` (OpenAI default). Voyage's `voyage-3` model returns 1024 dims. Migration `0003_resize_chunks_embedding_to_1024.sql` drops and recreates the column — pgvector cannot resize a vector column in place. There is no production data; if you have a local dev DB created before this fix, drop your `pgdata` volume (`docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d && pnpm --filter @questlog/server db:migrate`) and re-import any test sources.

## Tooling

### Turborepo version and `turbo.json` schema
Root **Turborepo** is pinned in `package.json` (e.g. **2.9.x**). Keep `turbo.json` `"$schema": "https://v{major}-{minor}-{patch}.turborepo.dev/schema.json"` aligned with the **resolved** version in `pnpm-lock.yaml`. After upgrading `turbo`, update the schema URL or run `npx @turbo/codemod migrate`.

### Dev server port (`EADDRINUSE`)
The API listens on **`PORT`** (default **3000**). If `pnpm dev` logs `EADDRINUSE`, something else already owns that port — the web app at :5173 will show connection errors. Free the port or set `PORT` and matching `VITE_API_URL` in `.env`.

### Campaign layout route + `AppShell` campaign id
Nested routes under **`campaign/:id`** use **`element: <Outlet />`** in `router.tsx`. **`AppShell`** parses the campaign id from **`location.pathname`** with **`/^\\/campaign\\/([^/]+)/`** so rail links stay correct for deep paths (e.g. **`chat/:conversationId`**). **Tablet `ContextPanel` overlay** used a full-viewport scrim (`inset: 0`) that sat above the rail and blocked **`NavLink`** clicks; scrim now starts at **`var(--rail-width)`**, and the rail uses **`z-index: 25`**. **`AppShell`** clears **`agentChatContextSources`** when the path leaves **`/campaign/:id/chat`**. **`useMediaQuery`** returns **`false`** and skips listeners when **`window.matchMedia`** is missing (jsdom).

### Biome is the sole linter + formatter — not ESLint or Prettier
Config is at root `biome.json`. Auto-fix: `pnpm exec biome check --write .` inside a package directory.

---

## TypeScript & Module Resolution

### `.js` extensions in imports are intentional
All TS source files use `.js` extensions (e.g., `import { foo } from "./bar.js"`). This is correct for `moduleResolution: "bundler"` targeting ESM. TypeScript resolves `.js` → `.ts` at type-check time. Do not remove or change them to `.ts`.

### `packages/shared` has no build step — intentional
`@questlog/shared` exports raw TypeScript via `"main": "./src/index.ts"`. Both Vite and tsx consume it directly via `workspace:*`. Add a build script only if the package needs to be published externally.

### Tailwind CSS v4 — no config file
Uses `@import "tailwindcss"` in CSS. Do not create `tailwind.config.js` — it is not used in v4.

### TypeScript project references — rules for cross-package imports
Each package has `composite: true`. Typecheck runs `tsc -b` (build mode), not `tsc --noEmit` — the two are incompatible with `composite` (TS6310). `tsc -b` emits `.js`/`.d.ts` to each package's `dist/` (gitignored). The web app imports `AppRouter` from the server via a `paths` alias (`@questlog/server/*`) backed by a project reference — not a relative path.

### superjson transformer must be on both client and server
`trpc.ts` and `apps/web/src/lib/trpc.ts` both use superjson. Required for `Date` objects from Drizzle to survive the wire. Removing it from either side breaks date serialization silently.

---

## Database

### postgres.js is the Drizzle driver — not `pg`
Use `drizzle-orm/postgres-js`. postgres.js is ESM-native; `pg` (node-postgres) is not.

### Import pipeline: storage provider and worker
- **Storage:** Pluggable `StorageProvider`; default is local filesystem (`UPLOAD_PATH`). Use `createMemoryStorage()` in tests. Swap for S3 without touching import service.
- **Worker:** Run `pnpm run process-imports` to process pending sources. No queue table — `sources.status` drives polling. `processSource` is idempotent.
- **Sources schema:** Extracted text and errors live in `metadata.extractedText` / `metadata.extractionError`, not top-level columns.

---

## Frontend

### Design system — entity-driven token system
The canonical reference is `Docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`. Key structural facts:
- **No single `--accent` color.** Each entity type has its own hue. `--accent` aliases `--ent-npc` (#60b8ff) for primary actions.
- **Four depth planes:** `--bg-void` → `--bg-surface` → `--bg-elevated` → `--bg-focal`. Don't add new background colors outside this system.
- **CSS custom properties, not Tailwind utilities**, for all layout and component styling. This is the foundation for per-campaign theming in Milestone 8. Components use inline `style` objects so token references are auditable.
- **Shared style presets** live in `apps/web/src/components/styles.ts` as `CSSProperties` objects. Spread into `style` prop and override as needed. Add new presets here, don't create one-off inline objects.

---

## Embedding

### Voyage AI — current model and key gotcha
Current model: `voyage-4-lite`. Env var: `VOYAGE_API_KEY`. Vector dimension: 1024 (`chunks.embedding vector(1024)`).

**`input_type` is required and matters:** always pass `input_type: "document"` when embedding source chunks, and `input_type: "query"` when embedding a search query. These produce asymmetric embeddings optimised for each role — omitting `input_type` degrades retrieval quality.

`voyage.client.ts` owns the HTTP client, model name, auth header, and batch size. Both `embedding.service.ts` and `search.service.ts` call `callVoyageEmbeddings()` from this module — do not add a second Voyage HTTP client elsewhere.

---

## Context Assembly

### Token budget and configuration
All magic numbers (budget ratios, recency weight, search limit, hybrid search constants) live in the exported `CONTEXT_CONFIG` object in `context.service.ts`. Edit there, not inline.

Default budget split (100 000 token total):

| Section  | Ratio | Tokens |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Chunks   | 60%   | 60 000 |
| History  | 25%   | 25 000 |
| Entities | 10%   | 10 000 |
| Metadata |  5%   |  5 000 |

### Hybrid search constants
`KEYWORD_SEARCH_THRESHOLD = 0.1`, `DUAL_MATCH_BOOST = 0.1`, `DEFAULT_SEARCH_LIMIT = 40`. Vector and keyword searches run in parallel; results merged via `mergeSearchResults()` before recency re-ranking. `mergeSearchResults` is exported for direct unit testing.

### `createdAt` is required on `SearchResult`
`search.service.ts` returns `createdAt: Date` on each result — needed for recency ranking. Tests that mock `searchService.search` must include this field or recency ranking will break.

### Test isolation via `fetchFn`
`ContextInput.fetchFn` is forwarded to the Voyage AI HTTP call. Inject a mock `fetch` in tests to avoid network calls — no env var patching needed.

---

## LLM & Conversation

### Dependency injection: `createLlmService(client?)`
Production code uses the default export `llmService`. Tests pass a mock Anthropic client via the factory. There is no module-level singleton or `resetClient()` helper.

### Configuration: `LLM_CONFIG`
Model (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`), `maxTokens` (4096), `maxHistoryMessages` (40). Same pattern as `CONTEXT_CONFIG` — edit there, not inline.

### Non-streaming `chat()` uses a transaction; streaming `chatStream()` does not
`chat()` wraps user message insert → context assembly → LLM call → assistant message insert in a single DB transaction. Guarantees no orphaned messages if the LLM call fails, but holds the transaction open for the duration of the call (5–30 s). Acceptable at single-user concurrency.

`chatStream()` saves the user message optimistically, streams, then saves the assistant message. Deletes the user message if the LLM fails mid-stream. Avoids the long-held transaction at the cost of a small window where a user message exists without a response.

### SSE endpoint — not tRPC — for streaming
`POST /api/conversation/:conversationId/stream` is a plain Fastify route. tRPC v11 subscriptions require WebSocket transport, which this stack doesn't have. Event types: `delta`, `done`, `error`.

### Error mapping
`LlmApiError` → tRPC error codes: 429/529 → `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`; all others → `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`.

### `ConversationMessage` and `MessageSource` are shared types
`ConversationMessage` lives in `packages/shared/src/types/conversation.ts` — used by both server and frontend. `MessageSource` (`{ chunkId, sourceName, sourceId }`) is defined in `db/schema/tables.ts` and exported from the schema barrel. The `messages.sources` column is typed as `MessageSource[]`, not `Record<string, unknown>[]`.

## Session notes (Milestone 4.5) — UI Component Library Refactor

### Style preset pattern vs component encapsulation
`styles.ts` continues to export style-preset objects (`buttonAccent`, `chipBase`, etc.) as the **implementation details** of the new components. Feature code must not import them directly. Components in `apps/web/src/components/` are the only importers.

### `Input` uses `forwardRef`
`Input.tsx` wraps `forwardRef` so callers needing a `ref` for focus management (e.g. `PasteTextInput`) can use `<Input ref={...}>` directly. This was added during M4.5 when the first ref-requiring callsite was encountered.

### `ConversationTags` tag pills are still NOT `<Chip>`
Each tag pill contains a nested remove `<button>`. Even after the component refactor, this remains intentionally inlined in `ConversationTags` because wrapping interactive children in a reusable chip primitive is still semantically awkward for this pattern.

### `SourceChip` now uses `<Chip>`
`Chip` was expanded to support `as="button"` and `variant="source"` with `sourceType` mapping, so `SourceChip` now composes `Chip` instead of re-spreading `sourceChipBase` and `sourceChipColors` directly.

### `SessionEditorPage` back-link is NOT `<Button>`
The `backLinkStyle` in `SessionEditorPage` is applied to a `<Link>` (react-router). `Button` renders a `<button>`. Rather than add a `Link` variant to `Button`, the `buttonGhost` values were inlined directly into the style object.

### `IconButton` `hoverStyle`/`pressStyle` props
`ChatInput`'s send and stop buttons need visually distinct hover/press states (accent glow vs border highlight). Rather than letting `ChatInput` manage the boolean hover state, `IconButton` accepts optional `hoverStyle`/`pressStyle` overrides. The callsite specifies WHAT to show; the component manages WHEN.

### `Modal` uses generated `aria-labelledby` ids
`Modal` uses React `useId()` for the title id and binds the dialog with `aria-labelledby={titleId}`. This keeps labels stable per instance and avoids id collisions for stacked dialogs.

### `Alert` wraps `Button`
`Alert`'s retry button uses `<Button variant="accent">` internally. This means `Alert` imports `Button` — keep this in mind if extracting to a separate package.

### Component directory organization after M4.5 polish
Shared components are now grouped under semantic subdirectories:
- `components/primitives` (e.g. `Input`, `Select`, `Textarea`, `FormField`, `Chip`)
- `components/feedback` (`Alert`)
- `components/layout` (`Modal`, `PageScaffold`)

Other top-level shared components (`Button`, `IconButton`, `Card`, `EntityAvatar`) remain at `components/` because they are already established app-wide entry points and are widely imported.

### M4.2 — Entity detection: PostgreSQL port forwarding for local dev
Project expects Docker on port 5433, but local PostgreSQL runs on 5432. Use `socat TCP-LISTEN:5433,fork,reuseaddr TCP:127.0.0.1:5432 &` to forward. Also requires: `pg_ctlcluster 16 main start` and `apt-get install -y postgresql-16-pgvector`.

### M4.2 — pg_trgm: `word_similarity` vs `similarity` for entity pre-filter
`word_similarity(query, text)` checks if any word in `text` is similar to `query`. Used for the low-threshold candidate pre-filter. `similarity(entity_name, token)` does character-level trigram comparison between two strings. Used for per-word comparison in the second phase to confirm a candidate entity matches a word in the scanned text. Both are required; using only one causes either too many or too few candidates.

### M4.2 — tRPC superjson transformer in integration tests
tRPC v11 with superjson transformer wraps GET query inputs as `{ json: { ...input } }`. When calling the HTTP endpoint directly in integration tests (not via the tRPC client), the query string must be `?input={"json":{...}}`. Using raw `?input={...}` causes input validation to fail silently.

### M4.2 — TipTap extension option refs
TipTap extension options are captured at extension creation time. To pass changing React state into the extension, create a `useRef` in the component, update it each render, and pass the ref object (not `.current`) into the extension options. The extension reads `ref.current` synchronously at event time. This avoids stale closures.

### M4.2 — `entity-highlight.css` co-location
`entity-highlight.css` lives in `features/session-log/styles/` and is imported by `SessionEditor.tsx`. This is intentional — it uses `:hover` pseudo-classes that require a stylesheet, and co-location keeps it adjacent to the extension it styles. Do not consolidate into `index.css`.

### M4.2 — Biome `noAssignInExpressions` with `regex.exec`
Biome flags `while ((match = regex.exec(text)) !== null)`. Rewrite as: `let result = regex.exec(text); while (result !== null) { ...; result = regex.exec(text); }`. This also avoids the need for `String.matchAll` which behaves differently with capture groups.
